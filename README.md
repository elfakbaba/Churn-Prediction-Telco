# Churn Prediction for Telco Customers
# Project Overview:

This project tackles the challenge of Telco customer churn prediction. Churn refers to a customer leaving a telecommunications company's services. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and analyzing customer data, we aim to develop a model that accurately forecasts which customers are at risk of churning.

# The Significance of Churn Prediction:

Churn estimation empowers telecommunications companies to proactively identify customers likely to cancel their services. Equipped with this knowledge, companies can implement targeted retention strategies, such as personalized offers and incentives, to keep valuable customers engaged and minimize churn. This ultimately leads to higher customer retention rates and increased revenue.

# Understanding the Dataset:

The project utilizes a dataset containing information about Telco customers. Key features within the dataset include:

-Customer demographics: Customer ID, gender, senior citizen status (Yes/No)
-Service utilization: Phone service (Yes/No), multiple phone lines (Yes/No/No service), internet service type (DSL, Fiber optic, No), additional services like online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, streaming TV, and streaming movies (all Yes/No with appropriate service dependencies)
-Contract details: Contract term (Month-to-month, One year, Two year)
-Billing information: Paperless billing (Yes/No), payment method (Electronic check, Mailed check, Bank transfer, Credit card)
-Customer financial data: Monthly charges and total charges incurred
-Target variable: Churn status (Yes/No)

# Result
Overall, this project explores the potential of machine learning for predicting customer churn in the telecommunications industry. By building a robust prediction model, we can empower companies to retain valuable customers and improve their bottom line.
