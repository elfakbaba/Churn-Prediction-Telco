# Churn-Prediction-Telco

Telco Churn Forecasting refers to the process of estimating which customers of a telecommunications company are most likely to cancel their services in the near future. Churn estimation can be performed by analyzing the factors that cause loss of customers. Using machine learning algorithms, Telco Churn Prediction models can be developed to analyze customer data and make accurate predictions about which customers are most likely to leave. This information can then be used to proactively reach customers at risk of leaving and offer incentives to stay, ultimately reducing churn and increasing customer retention rates.
